        <h1>The best motherfucking website</h1>
        <p>For real.</p>

        <h2>Styling?</h2>
        <p>You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
        <p>Well, guess what, you're <span class="brightred">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>
        
        <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
        <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsites</span></p>
        <ul><li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
            <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="google.com">Google home page</a></li>
            <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
            <li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
            <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem well, <span class="tiny">kind of</span></li>
            <li>Use some fucking <span id="a">colors</span>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
        <p>This website is even better than the last guy and the guy before him.<br>
        Why?</p>
        <ul><li>It's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
            <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript<img src="Javascriptlogo.svg" title="Javascript Logo" height="0.5m"> </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
        <div class="fancypositioning">
            <div class="pictureleft">
            <img src="Cat.jpg" title="Cat">
            </div>
            <div class="textright">
            <p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephenie Meyer, this is a <span class="red">motherfuckingwebsite</span>. Add some relevant pictures to give a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader. Do you really like to waste the power of technology that we have nowadays? Come on, you're using a web browser on a computer, you're not reading a book on a Kindle.</p>
            <p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
            <p>You see the picture of this cute cat? He's happy, and you should be too.</p>
