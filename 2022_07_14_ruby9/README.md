## crypto_scraper uses the website's API to get data, as lazy loading prevents scraping with nokogiri.

You may want to reduce the limit to 50 to test, as 9900+ cryptocurrencies will take North of 2 hours to scrape.

## cities_scraper runs as intended, some of the emails will be blank as they were not provided on the website.

Tests were not designed.
