## List of files

**game.rb** is the file that creates the class *Game* that allows you to create a new game.

**player.rb** is the file that creates the class *Player* and the class *HumanPlayer* that allow you to create new instances to play a game.

**app.rb**, **app2.rb** & **app3.rb** are three different ways to coordinate new games thanks to the class *Game*, *Player* and *HumanPlayer*, app.rb being the simpler one and app3.rb the more complex one

---

Usage

Each **app.rb** will create a new game, in which a Human Player (you) will fight other players (the computer) until either you or the computer loses.
